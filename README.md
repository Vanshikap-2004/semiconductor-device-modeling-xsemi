# Semiconductor Device Modeling Using X-Semi

This repository presents the design and modeling of a p–n junction diode and a
MOSFET using a novel wide-bandgap semiconductor. The project derives device
behavior from fundamental material parameters and analyzes realistic operating
conditions such as temperature and doping variations.
